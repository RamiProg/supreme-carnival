 What is problem solving?
Solving a problem 
Define the problem. Find the real problem, not just the symptoms that result from the problem. When defining the problem, do not consider things that are extraneous matters, only what the actual problem is. You can consider the other issues later. Become familiar with the problem and understand it fully.
        For example, if your room is constantly messy, the problem might not be that you’re a messy person. It might be that you lack containers or places to put your items in an organized way.
        Try to be as clear and thorough as possible when defining the problem. If it is a personal issue, be honest with yourself as to the causes of the problem. If it is a logistics problem, determine exactly where and when the problem occurs.
        Determine whether the problem is real or self-created. Do you need to solve this problem or is this about something you want? Putting things in perspective can help you navigate the problem-solving process.

Why it is important to understand a problem?
 Putting things in perspective can help you navigate the problem-solving process.
In order to find the right solution.
In order to devise and plan a right solution.

Why it is important to make a plan how to solve the problem?
In order to take the steps needed to solve it.
Because a plan will help you make the solution or the needed function.
 Make important decisions first. Recognize the decisions you need to make and how they will contribute to solving your problem. Making decisions can help you move forward in solving your problems, so start by deciding on what to focus on, what needs to get done, and how you will go about doing it.
        For example, you might have several problems to solve and need to decide which ones to tackle first. Solving one problem may ease tension or take stress off of another problem.
        Once you make a decision, don’t doubt yourself. Be willing to look forward from that point on without wondering what would have happened had you chosen something else.

Why it is important to divide the problem into small parts?
Because steps and small are more approachable.
Then you can work on each part on its own. 
Simplify the problem. An overly-complicated problem can feel overwhelming and be difficult to solve. If there are multiple problems, break them down into smaller parts and deal with them individually. If you can break the problem down into the smallest terms, this will help you in understanding it and finding a solution.
        For example, if you need to turn in many assignments to pass a class, focus on how many you have to do and approach them one by one.
        Try to combine and solve problems together whenever possible. For example, if you're running out of time to study, try listening to a recorded lecture while walking to class or flip through note cards as you're waiting for dinner.

Why it is important to debug a solution? 
In order to remove its bugs and its hidden problems and glitches.
We do not want our solution to have unsolved problems within it.
